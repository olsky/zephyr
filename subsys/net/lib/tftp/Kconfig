      Maximum size (defined in the number of characters) of each filename that we 
      can get or put to the TFTP Server. This is introduced to allow the user to scale up
      the size of request array that is not dynamically created (as we don't like dynamic 
      memory allocations).

    help
      Maximum amount of time (in seconds) that the TFTP Client will wait for data from the 
      TFTP Server. Once this time has elasped, the TFTP Client will assume that the Server 
      failed and close the connection.

    default 5
    help
      Once the TFTP Client sends out a request, it will wait TFTPC_REQUEST_TIMEOUT secs for the data 
      to arrive from the TFTP Server. However, if it doesn't arrive within the given time we will 
      re-transmit the request to the server in hopes that the server will respond within time to this 
      request. This number dictates the number of times we will do re-tx of our request before giving up
      and exiting.
